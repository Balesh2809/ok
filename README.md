# My Travel Website

This is my first project for HTML assignment.  
I made a simple travel website using only HTML.  

## What is inside
- Headings and paragraphs with bold, italic, underline, strike  
- Images of travel destination and activity  
- Links (inside page, external link, and homepage link)  
- Lists (ordered, unordered, and definition list)  
- Table for travel packages  
- Contact details  

## How to use
Just open the `index.html` file in browser.  

## Project Info
- Project Name: Travel Website  
- Project Code: HTML-001
